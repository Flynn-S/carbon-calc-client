# Carbon Calc Client

This is the frontend for a carbon offset calculator app built with react.

Adding or deleting rows from the table or changing the country from the dropdown will update the graph on the right.

You can add data to the table using the add button, but you cannot specify the date, and the number of trees is randomly generated to save time.

Unfortunately the graphs x axis labels cannot be seen, but each tick represents 1 month of time.
